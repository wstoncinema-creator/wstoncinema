<h5>The rise of streaming services and how WsTon Cinema stands out</h5>
<p>
  Over the past decade, streaming services have experienced an explosive rise in popularity, fundamentally changing how people consume entertainment. Traditional television and cable are becoming less dominant as more viewers turn to platforms that allow them to watch movies and TV shows on-demand via the internet. Here’s an overview of the rise of streaming services and how WsTon Cinema stands out among the competition:
